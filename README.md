Problem Statement

Design a system that sends an email notification to the user every three hours with a summary of their LinkedIn activity. The email should be delivered to the user’s Gmail account and include the total number of unread LinkedIn messages and unread LinkedIn notifications. Additionally, the email should compare the current unread counts with those from the previous notification cycle to highlight any changes.
